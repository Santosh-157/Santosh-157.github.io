Hello everyone,
My name is Santosh,a student of class 10(ten)
from Mother's Pride Academy, Manipur.
This is my first ever website so created with the help of 
GitHub.
With such small basics we can perform all our projects
creations and innovations, quite easier and simpler
Indeed.
So, I recommend all my friends and colleagues to use
GitHub platform in creating and designing your own web
sites.


PROJECTS:
project name: Smart farming

Problem: In some countries like India,where agriculture is
the backbone of the economy illiterate farmers faces
a lot of inconveniences and problems.
"Disease vs crops" is burning topic right now.
When any sort of bacteria,fungi, nematodes or biotic agents
attack the plants,37% of Indian farmers refuse to
go to laboratories,test them and apply the best
cure.Cause it's consuming time, money and energy.

Instead they are ready to invest bags of fertilizer, pesticides even
vitamins.This will make the crops bright and beautiful in the eyes of this
1.3 billion population but it is indeed a dome of poisonous substances,
causing deformaties,cancers, pollutions nad and all.
