Hello everyone,
My name is Santosh,a student of class 10(ten)
from Mother's Pride Academy, Manipur.
This is my first ever website so created with the help of 
GitHub.
With such small basics we can perform all our projects
creations and innovations, quite easier and simpler
Indeed.
So, I recommend all my friends and colleagues to use
GitHub platform in creating and designing your own web
sites.


PROJECTS:
project name: Smart farming

Problem: In some countries like India,where agriculture is
the backbone of the economy illiterate farmers faces
a lot of inconveniences and problems.
"Disease vs crops" is burning topic right now.
